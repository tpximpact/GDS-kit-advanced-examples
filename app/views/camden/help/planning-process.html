    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="submitting">Submitting an application</h2>
    <p>An application can be submitted by the person who wants to apply (the applicant) or by a professional with experience of planning applications (an agent) acting on the applicant's behalf.</p>
    <p>When an application is submitted through a service like Planning Portal or PlanX, it is passed directly to the local planning authority to be worked on.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="validation">Application validation</h2>
    <p>Before an application can be assessed, the planning authority first needs to ensure it is valid. This means making sure it has included all the necessary information and documents.</p>
    <p>If an application is missing information, planning officers may need to contact the applicant, which will delay the validation process.</p>
    <p>Once an application is validated, it is published on the planning register.</p>
      
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="consultation">Public consultation</h2>
    <p>The public must be consulted for some applications. For example, people may need to be notified about changes proposed to a neighbouring building.</p>
    <p>For large developments like shopping centres or housing estates, the local community must be informed and given the opportunity to support or object to the proposed work.</p>
    <p>Consultations have to go on for at least 21 days, excluding bank holidays and public holidays. The council must wait until the consultation period ends before they make their decision.</p>
    <p>Applicants can make changes to their application in response to comments that are published, to address any issues raised.</p>
    <p>Applications that don't need a public consultation will be assessed immediately. </p>
    
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="assessment">Application Assessment</h2>
    <p>An application is assessed by a planning case officer. They check that the application meets all relevant policies, which are set out in the council's <a href="https://www.camden.gov.uk/camden-local-plan1" target="_blank">Local Plan</a>.</p>
    <p>If the application had a public consultation, they will also review all the comments they received. They must consider all comments which are related to <a href="https://www.camden.gov.uk/commenting-planning-application" target="_blank">material considerations</a>. The case officer may also consult with experts, such as specialist officers within the council and relevant government bodies.</p>
    <p>The council may contact the applicant and suggest changes to the application to meet the council's policies. This will delay the assessment process.</p>
    <p>All decisions are reviewed by supervising members of the planning office, so no one person can make a decision alone. Sometimes a planning application will need to be decided by a planning committee made up of elected councillors. They will make the final decision after the application has been assessed by an officer.</p>
    
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="decisions">Decisions</h2>
    <p>When a decision is made a decision notice is published which contains all the information about the assessment of the application. The decision notice will explain why an application was granted or refused, and if there are any special considerations or measures. If a consultation was done, this decision notice includes responses to all relevant points raised by comments.</p>
    
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="appeals">Appeals</h2>
    <p>If an applicant or an affected community do not agree with the council's decision on a planning application, they can register an appeal with the planning inspectorate.</p>
    <p>The planning inspectorate will check that the council has followed due process, taken everything into account that they should have, and no corruption or other illegal activity has occurred.</p>
    <p>Once the planning inspectorate has completed their process, the council's original decision will either be repealed or upheld. The planning inspectorate's decision is final.</p>
